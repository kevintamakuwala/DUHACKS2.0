## The problem FarMart solves.
Our initiative is helping farmers with huge farms in managing their tasks by hiring us and we are providing them with our work force and tools. We are an online platform that connects farmers with customers looking for fresh, high-quality produce straight from the farm. Our mission is to support farmers and promote sustainable agriculture practices by making it easy for consumers to purchase locally sourced, farm-fresh products. At FarMart, we offer a wide range of products including fresh fruits and vegetables, herbs, dairy products, meat, and poultry. All of our products come directly from local farms, and we ensure that they are of the highest quality and free from any harmful chemicals or pesticides
As FarMart, we believe in providing fair prices to our farmers and ensuring that they receive a fair share of the profits. By choosing to shop with us, you are supporting local farmers and helping to promote sustainable farming practices in your community.

## Challenges we ran into.
As we choose one of the oldest technologies to work with PHP we ran into many challenges related to session and database connection.
the BUG of session was the most time taking as the session which we are setting was not displaying in other file.
and there was a bug for entering data in address table as the table of address and customer was different and it was again time taking.
